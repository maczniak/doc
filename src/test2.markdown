# Lessons Learned

Unlike the SocialCalc project's well-defined specification and team development process, EtherCalc was a solo experiment from mid-2011 to late-2012 and served as a proving ground for assessing Node.js' readiness for production use.

This unconstrained freedom afforded an exciting opportunity to try all sorts of alternative languages, libraries, algorithms and architectures. Here, I'd like to share a few lessons I've learned during this 18-month experiment.

## Constraints are Liberating

In his book *The Design of Design*, Fred Brooks argues that by shrinking the designer's search space, constraints can help to focus and expedite a design process. This includes self-imposed constraints:

> Artificial constraints for one's design task have the nice property that one is free to relax them. Ideally, they push one into an unexplored corner of a design space, stimulating creativity.
